            <h3>Journey :</h3>
            <p id="journey">(1) I hold vivid memories of our college conducting classes online during our first
                semester. Little did I know when I sent you that very first message, that you would become such an
                indispensable part of my life. Our initial conversation revolved around introductions, asking about each
                other, our whereabouts, and even suggesting that you could join us for a meet-up. Back then, my
                impression of you was casual, not paying meticulous attention to every detail. But now, as I pen down
                these words, our relationship has flourished over the past six months, and our journey together feels
                like a captivating movie. I recollect the times when my college friends and I made plans to visit the
                campus, and I would occasionally ask if we should meet there, considering the online nature of our
                classes. However, you would decline, embracing your introverted nature 😂.

        <p>Kashish and I have been enrolled in the BCA department at St. Xavier's College since 2021. Despite our
            differing backgrounds, with Kashish belonging to the upper middle class and myself hailing from the
            middle-middle class, we have embarked on a remarkable journey together. This narrative encapsulates our
            experiences from the first year to the third year starting days. It was during the first week of January
            2023
            when we mustered the courage to confess our feelings for each other.</p>
